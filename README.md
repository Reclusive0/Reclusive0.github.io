# David Neill - Portfolio Project

Hi! This is the repo for my portfolio site, thanks for being interested enough to take a look at the backend. This version of the project has been done as part of my time with [\_nology](https://au.nology.io/), a tech training and talent provider.

#### The requirements for this project:

- Using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)/SCSS for styling.
- Using [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology.
- Placing responsiveness as a high priority. Try checking the website on your phone or tablet to see how it holds up!
